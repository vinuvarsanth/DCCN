Example:
Scenario:

You have 3 frames, each 8 bits long:
Frame 1: 11001100
Frame 2: 10101010
Frame 3: 11110000
We will calculate the checksum at the sender, then simulate the received frames (which include the checksum) to verify if the data was received correctly.

Step 1: Calculate Checksum at the Sender
Convert each frame to decimal:

Frame 1: 11001100 = 204
Frame 2: 10101010 = 170
Frame 3: 11110000 = 240
Sum the decimal values:

Sum = 204 + 170 + 240 = 614
Handle overflow (keep the sum within 8 bits):

The maximum value for 8 bits is 255 (2^8 - 1).
To handle overflow, we calculate the carry and adjust the sum.
The overflow calculation is:
614 % 256 = 102 (this is the part that fits within 8 bits)
614 / 256 = 2 (carry, which will be added back)
Add the carry:

New sum = 102 + 2 = 104 (after handling overflow)
Calculate one's complement:

The one's complement of 104 in binary is:
104 in binary: 01101000
One's complement (flip the bits): 10010111
Checksum:

The checksum is 10010111.
Step 2: Transmit Frames with Checksum
The frames sent from the sender to the receiver would now include:

Frame 1: 11001100
Frame 2: 10101010
Frame 3: 11110000
Checksum: 10010111
Step 3: Verify Checksum at the Receiver
Receiver gets all frames including checksum:

Frame 1: 11001100 = 204
Frame 2: 10101010 = 170
Frame 3: 11110000 = 240
Checksum: 10010111 = 151
Sum the frames and the checksum:

Sum = 204 + 170 + 240 + 151 = 765
Handle overflow (keep the sum within 8 bits):

The overflow calculation is:
765 % 256 = 253
765 / 256 = 2 (carry)
Add the carry:

New sum = 253 + 2 = 255
Check if the result is all ones:

255 in binary is 11111111, which is all ones.
This means the data was received correctly, with no errors.
Conclusion:
Since the final sum is all ones (11111111), the checksum verification succeeded, indicating that there was no error in the transmitted data.
In this example, the checksum 10010111 was calculated at the sender. The receiver verified that the transmitted data (including the checksum) resulted in an all-ones sum, confirming the data's integrity.
